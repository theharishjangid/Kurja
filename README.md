## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the Kurja project on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  Version 18.x or later is recommended. You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v` in your terminal.
*   **npm:** (Usually comes with Node.js) or **yarn** or **pnpm** or **bun**
*   **Git:** For version control.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Kurja
    ```

    *   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the Kurja repository.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
    * Add any necessary environment variables to this file.
    * Example:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically update as you make changes to the code.
